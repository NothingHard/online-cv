  title: "Early Detection of Neurodegeneration"
  link: "https://nothinghard.github.io/projects/1_2017-12-16-MRI_cmc"
  time: "Dec 2017"
  tag: "Research topic: jointly work with NTU Hospital"
  tagline: '
  <li> Built a 3D CNN using brain MRI raw image to predict chronological ages
  <li> Interpreted the difference between chronological age and predicted age as the severity of brain aging
  <li> Faciliated early detection of neurodegeneration or age-related cognitive decline
  <li> Technical details:
    <ul>
      <li> Devised a bottleneck architecture to ease the training of networks</li>
      <li> Adopted the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf">instance normalization</a> for better adaptation across subjects</li>
      <li> Achieved MAE = 4.29, Correlation = 0.95 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for predicting chronological ages
    </ul>
