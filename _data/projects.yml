  tagline: '
  <li> Built a 3D convolutional neural network using brain MRI raw image to predict chronological ages
  <li> Interpreted the difference between chronological age and brain-predicted age as the severity of neurodegeneration
  <li> Diagnosed early-stage neurodegeneration or age-related cognitive decline with the help of the proposed model
  <li> Technical details:
    <ul>
      <li> Devised a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">bottleneck architecture</a> to ease the training of networks</li>
      <li> Adopted the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf">instance normalization</a> for better adaptation across subjects</li>
      <li> Achieved MAE = 4.29, Correlation = 0.95 and R-squared = 0.91 for predicting chronological ages
    </ul>
