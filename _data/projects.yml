  <li> Detect early-stage neurodegeneration using a novel 3D convolutional neural networks
  <li> Consider (1) the deeper bottleneck architecture like ResNet, and (2) instance normalization in 3D CNN for better adaptation across subjects
  <li> Demonstrate the effectiveness to predict chronological age over 558 healthy individuals with MAE = 4.29, Correlation = 0.95 and R squared = 0.91
