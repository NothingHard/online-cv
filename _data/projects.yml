- project:
  title: "Early Detection of Neurodegeneration"
  link: "https://nothinghard.github.io/projects/1_2017-12-16-MRI_cmc"
  time: "Dec 2017"
  tag: "Research topic: jointly work with NTU Hospital"
  tagline: '
  <p> - Built a 3D CNN using brain MRI raw image to predict chronological ages and 
  the difference between chronological age and predicted age is quantified as the severity of neurodegeneration
  <p> - Technical details:
    <ul>
      <li> Devised a bottleneck architecture to ease the training of networks</li>
      <li> Adopted the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf">instance normalization</a> for better adaptation across subjects</li>
      <li> Achieved MAE = 4.29, Correlation = 0.95 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for predicting chronological ages
    </ul>

- project:
  title: "In-depth Study on Batch Normalization"
  link: "https://nothinghard.github.io/projects/1_2017-07-01-BN_cmc"
  time: "Jul 2017"
  tag: "Course project: Machine Learning and having it Deep and Structured (MLDS), NTU"
  tagline: "
  <p> - Investigated the mechanism of batch normalization in both theoretical and experimental aspects and 
  provided some possible explanations on why batch normalization works so well
  <p> - Won the 1st place in peer reviews and the 2nd place in the oral presentation voted by audience
  Github repository: https://github.com/NothingHard/MLDS_final_2017
   <!-- <p> - Verified the following claims made by authors
    <ul>
      <li>BN solved the issue of gradient vanishing (by visualizing magnitude of gradients)
      <li>BN helped regularize the weigths (by monitoring the growth of weights)
      <li>BN benefit gradient flow through network (by analyzing the distribution of singular values of layerâ€™s Jacobian)
    </ul>-->
