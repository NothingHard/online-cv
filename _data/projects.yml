  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Investigated batch normalization in both theoretical and experimental aspects and 
  explained why batch normalization works so well in terms of layer Jacobian distributions
  (<a href='https://github.com/twcmchang/MLDS_final_2017'>github</a>)
  <!--
  <p> - Won the 1st place in peer reviews and the 2nd place in the oral presentation voted by audience and 
  the github repository: <a href='https://github.com/twcmchang/MLDS_final_2017'>why batch normalization works so well</a>
    <p> - Verified the following claims made by authors
    <ul>
      <li>BN solved the issue of gradient vanishing (by visualizing magnitude of gradients)
      <li>BN helped regularize the weigths (by monitoring the growth of weights)
      <li>BN benefit gradient flow through network (by analyzing the distribution of singular values of layerâ€™s Jacobian)

  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Developed a 3D CNN to predict chronological ages, achieving MAE=4.2 and Cor=0.95 in the test dataset. Quantified the severity of neurodegeneration as the difference of predicted and chronological ages
  <!--<p> - Technical details:
    <ul>
      <li> Devised a bottleneck architecture to ease the training of networks</li>
      <li> Adopted the <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf'>instance normalization</a> for better adaptation across subjects</li>
      <li> Achieved MAE = 4.29, Correlation = 0.95 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for predicting chronological ages
