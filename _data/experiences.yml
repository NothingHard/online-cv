  <p>- Project manager/engineer: implemented and coordinated a very first IoT demonstration of 
  applying Microsoft Azure service in the smart home scenario,
  including gathering data from IoT devices to Azure Event Hub,
  detecting abnormal behaviors by Azure Streaming Analytics and Azure Machine Learning, and
  pushing emergence notifications to end devices by Azure Notification Hub.
  <p>- Engineer: improved the above IoT demonstration by incorporating Microsoft Voice Assistant, Cortana, into the scenario.
  For example, control the on/off of the Philips Hue, open the door, or play a song through Cortana."
