  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Proposed a channel-prioritized training procedure to allow CNNs having both sparsity and dynamic inference at the same time.
  Experiments of CIFAR-10 on VGG-16 show 94.6% parameter reduction without compromising accuracy

  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Innovated an algorithm, task-wise early stopping and loss aggregation (TESLA), 
  to allow dynamically trade-offs between various resource and performance requirements. Maintained 88% accuracy on CIFAR-10 when computation cost limited to 2.5% in VGG16

  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Developed a 3D CNN to predict chronological ages using raw fMRI images. Reached MAE=4.2 and Cor=0.95 in the test dataset. 
  can be applied in early detecting neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease

  <p><font color='#fb8072'>[DL]</font> Proposed a non-invasive glucose measurement method using ECG ang PPG signals. Proposed 1D CNNs to handel time-serie signals
  achieved 93.5% clinically correct decisions and 6.5% uncritical decisions

  <p><font color='#4daf4a'>[ML]</font> Investigated the relationships between crimes and various geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors,
  accepted <a href='https://twcmchang.github.io/files/ACIIDS17_cmc.pdf'>full paper</a> by 2017 ACIIDS

  <p><font color='#984ea3'>[DA]</font> Proposed a methodology to quantify performance of commercial-level VR head-mounted display devices 
  in timing and positioning, accepted <a href='https://twcmchang.github.io/files/ACM_MM16_cmc.pdf'>full paper</a> by 2016 ACM multimedia

  <p>Addressed real-world problems by machine learning, such as churn prediction in subscription-based telecom services, 
  real-time pricing in online platforms, and income prediction using liked Facebook fan pages etc.
